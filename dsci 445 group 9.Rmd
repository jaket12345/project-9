```{r}

 

```





```{r}

for(x in 1:2825){ #length of your music dataframes ( number of rows)
  
  #the value of Genres in the origial dataframe is actually just one big character variable, which is why its harder to get just the first genre out
  #musicGenres is the "list" of genres that are in the original dataframe
  #dataframe will be the name of your music dataframe
  #MainGenre is the main genre that it pulls from the musicGenres variable
  
 musicGenres <- dataframe[x,11]  #puts genres into variable. The 11 is the column that the gerne variable is in.
 
 musicGenres <- as.data.frame(musicGenres) #turns it into a dataframe
 
 MainGenre <- musicGenres %>% separate(musicGenres, c("Main Genre"), sep = ',') # grabs first genre in list
  MainGenre
dataframe[x,11] <- MainGenre #sets first genre to genre value in dataframe
}
