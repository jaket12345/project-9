Spotify Music Analytics
"By Jay Jemila, Jacob Thompson, Jack Deere"
Overview of Our Goals
Jay: To look for trends and similarities in tracks that have at least
one billion streams (on Spotify).
Jacob: To look for trends and changes in popular Rap music by
decade and as a whole.
Jack: Looking for trends in different genres and comparing them
to each other.
Data Collection
Using Exportify we were able to extract information about songs contained within a playlist. These files
contain numerous variables that we were able to use to investigate our questions of interest.
Our Variables,
According to Spotify’s Web Application Programming Interface (API) developer guide,
●,"Popularity: 0 to 100 scale, attempting to quantify popularity of a song by total plays within the time since it’s release"
●,Duration (ms): Length of song
●,Danceability: “Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including
,"tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.”"
●,"Energy: “Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and "
,"noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.”"
●,Loudness: “The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track 
,and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks.”
●,"Tempo: “The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the "
,"speed or pace of a given piece, and derives directly from the average beat duration.”"
●,Valence: “Describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive 
,"(e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).”"
●,Genre: Classifies music by it’s genre as determined on Spotify.
●,"Mode: “Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is "
,derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.”
